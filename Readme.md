```diff
+ If you have cloned this repository, make sure you do a "git pull origin master" as I update files weekly
+ and add new experiments as the NPTEL weeks unfold.
```

```diff
- Deleting the Documents(PDF) - Doc Folder
- The Documents provided in the original repository were outdated
- and can also be found on the internet, if required
- They were big bulk files and were taking up major space.
- So, I deleted them.
```

```diff
! Now the repository does not contain any doc about BSL program, MSP430 LunchBox & LaunchPad UART
